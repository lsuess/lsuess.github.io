===== Interests =====
My primary interests lie in the area of **advanced forms of manufacturing** (both in the near and the more remote future) which foster **material deglobalization. **This is about local methods of manufacturing which can replace industrial methods of manufacturing without an unacceptable loss of product functionality. In the near future there lies //3D-printing and small scale robotic assembly// that's usable at home. In the more remote future there's [[Atomically precise Manufacturing|atomically precise manufacturing]] of// with gem-gum-factories //for your pants pockets.

Furthermore I'm interested in **advanced forms of programming.**
That is programming languages that where [[Discovered Programming Languages|discovered]] and not invented (citing Phillip Wadler). Such languages are — to little surprise — more practical for very large scale system engineering.

Here are some details about the [[Motivations|origins of my interests]] i.e. my motivations.
More of my far reaching other secondary technical interests can be found **here** (nothing published yet). If you want to know about my recreational interests you best get to know me personally / contact me per mail.

A few other things which I have published are dispersed over the respectively matching web-hosting-providers (provided there are suitable gratis hosting-services). Here's a [[https://sites.google.com/site/mechadense/home|link to my diverse presences on the web]].
