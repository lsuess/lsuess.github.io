====== Discovered Programming Languages ======

* **Video:** "[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOiZatlZtGU|Propositions as Types]]"  Presentation by Philip Wadler 

If you are a programmer and you haven't yet checked out at least one programming language that has strong guarantees for the non-existence of mutation of hidden state (aka pureness / declarativeness) I highly recommend to do so. Some programming languages with this property are: Haskell / Purescript / Elm / OpenSCAD / ... Of course like all programming languages those have their fair share of problems too.
