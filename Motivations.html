<h1>Motivations</h1>

<strong>the rapidly increasing rift between the physical world and the virtual world - the web</strong>. Advanced 3D modeling is what lies smack in the middle of the two.<br>
<br>
With time I realized that beside just feeling right for me the things I pursue actually mesh together and may have significant value for humanity as a whole. I now have high confidence that with future gem-gum-factories virtually all of the currently most pressing civilization problems could be solved. Not to say that no other problems will pop up. (I've identified some potential candidates).<br>
<br>
I feel l have the capacity to make a difference for future generations.<br>
Actually I think that today all the the people that are fortunate enough to not being bound by the clutches of extreme poverty have the capacity to make a difference. I think so because in general in this new age of the the informationally interconnected world ideas do not get "used up". They continuously accumulate. Thus no matter how small our individual contributions are they stay around and they potentially count. Examples of the new power/influence of individuals (both positive and negative) are already countless and those stories are accumulating at an increasingly faster rate.<br>
<br>
One should be aware though that the value of one's creations usually does not grows proportional to the work one invests. Like when assembling a puzzle the accumulated work often needs to reach a certain amount at which pretty suddenly all the ends connect together at once (like a <em>percolation threshold - </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percolation_threshold" title="wikipedia" class="https">wikipedia</a>)<br>
Valuable work is often met with silence or even malice but if it makes sense and one keeps going (for decades) eventually something big may happen. In regards to that I like this philosophy: <strong>If one not even ties to make a difference one is almost certain to make no difference.</strong><br>
